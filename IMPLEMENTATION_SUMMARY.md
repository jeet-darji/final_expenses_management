# Implementation Summary - Sequential Approval Workflow

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Sequential Multi-Step Approval Workflow**
The system now supports a complete sequential approval workflow where expenses move through defined steps in order.

#### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ **Manager as First Approver** - Expenses automatically route to the submitter's manager when `isManagerStep` is enabled
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Approval Steps** - Admin can define unlimited steps (e.g., Manager ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Director)
- ‚úÖ **Sequential Processing** - Each step must be completed before moving to the next
- ‚úÖ **Approve/Reject with Comments** - All approvers can add comments when making decisions
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Approvers per Step** - Support for threshold-based approvals (e.g., 2 out of 3 must approve)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Approval** - Expenses below threshold ($50 default) are auto-approved
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging** - All workflow actions are logged for compliance

## üîß Required Actions

### **CRITICAL: Database Fix Required**

Before the system will work, you **MUST** run this SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE audit_logs DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS audit_logs_entity_id_fkey;
```

#### How to Execute:
1. Open **pgAdmin 4**
2. Connect to `expense_management` database
3. Open Query Tool (Right-click database ‚Üí Query Tool)
4. Paste the SQL above
5. Execute (F5)
6. Restart your backend server

**Why:** The `audit_logs` table has an incorrect foreign key that only allows expense IDs, but the system logs actions for users, companies, approvals, etc.

---

## üéØ How the Workflow Works

### **Example Flow:**

```
1. Employee submits expense ($500)
   ‚Üì
2. System checks if auto-approvable (< $50)
   ‚Üì NO
3. System finds applicable approval flow
   ‚Üì
4. Creates approval for Step 1 (Manager)
   ‚Üì
5. Manager sees expense in "Pending Approvals"
   ‚Üì
6. Manager approves with comment
   ‚Üì
7. System moves to Step 2 (Finance)
   ‚Üì
8. Finance user sees expense in "Pending Approvals"
   ‚Üì
9. Finance approves with comment
   ‚Üì
10. System moves to Step 3 (Director)
    ‚Üì
11. Director approves with comment
    ‚Üì
12. No more steps ‚Üí Expense APPROVED
    ‚Üì
13. Employee notified
```

### **If Rejected at Any Step:**
```
Manager rejects at Step 1
   ‚Üì
Expense status = "rejected"
   ‚Üì
Workflow STOPS
   ‚Üì
Employee notified with rejection reason
```

---

## üìä Database Schema

### **Key Tables:**

#### `approval_flows`
- Defines the approval workflow
- Can be specific to amount ranges or categories
- One flow can have multiple steps

#### `approval_steps`
- Defines each step in the workflow
- `step_number` determines sequence (1, 2, 3...)
- `is_manager_step` auto-routes to submitter's manager
- `assigned_user_ids` for specific approvers
- `approval_threshold` for multi-approver steps

#### `approvals`
- Individual approval records
- One per approver per step
- Tracks status, decision, comments, timestamps

#### `expenses`
- `current_step_id` - Which step the expense is currently at
- `approval_flow_id` - Which workflow is being used
- `status` - Overall status (pending, approved, rejected)

## üöÄ API Endpoints Available

### **For Managers/Approvers:**

```http
# Get pending approvals
GET /api/approvals/pending

# Approve expense
POST /api/approvals/:approvalId/decision
{
  "decision": "approved",
  "comments": "Approved for business use"
}

# Reject expense
POST /api/approvals/:approvalId/decision
{
  "decision": "rejected",
  "comments": "Not a valid business expense"
}

# View all approvals (with filters)
GET /api/approvals?status=pending&dateFrom=2025-10-01
```

### **For Admins:**

```http
# Create approval flow
POST /api/companies/:companyId/approval-flows
{
  "name": "Standard Approval",
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepNumber": 1,
      "name": "Manager Approval",
      "isManagerStep": true
    },
    {
      "stepNumber": 2,
      "name": "Finance Review",
      "assignedUserIds": ["finance-user-id"]
    }
  ]
}

# Get all flows
GET /api/companies/:companyId/approval-flows

```http
# Submit expense
POST /api/companies/:companyId/expenses
{
  "amount": 250.00,
  "currency": "USD",

  "dateOfExpense": "2025-10-04"
}

# View my expenses
GET /api/companies/:companyId/users/:userId/expenses

# Check approval status
GET /api/companies/:companyId/expenses/:expenseId/approvals
```

## üé® Frontend Integration Points

### **Manager Dashboard:**
```javascript
// Fetch pending approvals
const pendingApprovals = await fetch('/api/approvals/pending', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Display count badge
<Badge>{pendingApprovals.count}</Badge>

// Show approval cards
{pendingApprovals.data.map(approval => (
  <ApprovalCard
    expense={approval.expense}
    step={approval.approvalStep}
    onApprove={() => handleApprove(approval.id)}
    onReject={() => handleReject(approval.id)}
  />
))}
```

### **Approval Action:**
```javascript
const handleApprove = async (approvalId, comments) => {
  await fetch(`/api/approvals/${approvalId}/decision`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      decision: 'approved',
      comments: comments
    })
  });
  
  // Refresh pending approvals
  refreshApprovals();
};
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] Database constraint fixed (SQL command executed)
- [ ] Backend server restarted
- [ ] At least 3 users exist:
  - [ ] Admin (role: 'admin')
  - [ ] Manager (role: 'manager', canApproveExpenses: true)
  - [ ] Employee (role: 'employee', managerId: <manager-id>)
- [ ] Default approval flow created

### **Test Scenarios:**
1. [ ] Employee submits expense
2. [ ] Manager sees it in pending approvals
3. [ ] Manager approves with comment
4. [ ] Expense moves to next step (if exists) or gets approved
5. [ ] Test rejection at each step
6. [ ] Test multi-step workflow (3+ steps)
7. [ ] Test multiple approvers with threshold
8. [ ] Verify audit logs are created
