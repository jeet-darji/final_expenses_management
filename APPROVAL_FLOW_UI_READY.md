## 📊 Approval Rules Explained

### **1. Single Approver**
- One person must approve
- Best for manager steps

### **2. Multiple Approvers with Threshold**
- Set percentage required (e.g., 60%)
- Example: 3 out of 5 must approve

### **3. Veto Rule**
- If enabled: ANY rejection = expense rejected
- If disabled: Need enough rejections to fail threshold

### **4. Manager Step**
- Automatically routes to employee's manager
- No need to assign specific users
- Perfect for first step
