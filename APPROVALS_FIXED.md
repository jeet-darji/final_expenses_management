# ✅ Approvals System - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Approvals Page Tabs** ✅
- **Pending Tab** - Shows only pending approvals
- **Approved Tab** - Shows approved approvals with details
- **Rejected Tab** - Shows rejected approvals with reasons
- Tabs now properly filter and display data

### **2. Backend API** ✅
- Changed `/api/approvals/pending` to return ALL approvals (not just pending)
- Frontend now filters by status for each tab
- Includes full expense and user details

### **3. Approve/Reject Functionality** ✅
- Fixed API endpoints to use `/api/approvals/:id/decision`
- After approval/rejection, item moves to correct tab
- Page auto-refreshes to show updated data
